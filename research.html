<h3>Research</h3>
<br>
Our research interests are in the areas of machine learning, anomaly detection, security and privacy, and distributed systems. Our work has broadly combined principles of the design, analysis, and development of fundamental machine learning algorithms with diverse application areas including 5G/6G, Internet of Things, Edge Computing, Multi-clouds, Anomaly Detection, Healthcare, and Vehicular Communication. We are looking forward to the problem in security and privacy leveraging machine learning for various autonomous systems. Over the past five years, our interests have evolved to include topics in (big and small data) security analytics, machine learning, security and privacy, anomaly detection, adversarial learning, and Internet measurement. Our approach in researching these areas considered exploratory, constructive, and empirical methods. A common theme in our most recent research work is the development or improvement of machine learning algorithms with application to detect, prevent, diagnosis of faults or failures or anomalies from a single system to large-scale infrastructures. Further, we also have been looking into security analytics: traffic, infrastructure usage, autonomous management of infrastructures in real-world deployments. Our earlier work focused on understanding various security issues in multiple enterprise networks context, by design and analysis.<br><br>

<h3>Machine learning</h3>
Almost all scientific and social disciplines are faced with an ever-increasing demand to analyze datasets that are unprecedented in scale (amount of data and its dimensionality) as well as the degree of corruption (noise, outliers, missing and indirect observations). Extraction of meaningful information from such big and dirty datasets requires achieving the competing goals of computational efficiency and statistical optimality (optimal accuracy for a given amount of data). My research goal is to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between these two quantities, and design algorithms that can learn and leverage the inherent structure of data in the form of clusters, graphs, subspaces and manifolds to achieve such tradeoffs.
<br><br>
Additionally, AI brings several benefits when deploying a model in real-time systems. These features open-up several challenges to ensure trustworthiness. Here, the primary goal is to design algorithms that provide trustworthiness under different settings. These algorithms rigorously investigate the input, model and output, leveraging (a) geometric and statistical distribution of data, (b) adversarial features with a significant amount of attack variation, (c) internal behaviour analysis of models, (d) model-agnostic vulnerability analysis, (e) security-aware design of models to address the adversarial attacks. These features improve the performance, scalability, robustness and transparency of the models. Further, it aims to explore the following aspects.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Privacy-preserving learning systems: (i) how to maximize the discovery capability of (deep) machine learning algorithms while maintaining data privacy with a minimum amount of resources? (ii) how to ensure data privacy in federated learning? (iii) how to ensure privacy in distributed learning?</li>
<br>
<li>Large-scale machine learning systems: (i) how to optimize energy-performance for machine learning clusters via scheduling and sprinting policies? (ii) how to optimize learning algorithms to achieve the best efficiency? (iii) how to learn from small data?</li>
<br>
<li>Machine learning perspective optimization methods: Due to the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of model complexity, optimization methods in machine learning face more and more challenges to improve performance and efficiency. Our focus is mainly on regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security Analytics</h3>
Software is part of everything electronic around us: software runs on personal computers, refrigerators, security cameras, security gates, and smartphones. There is good software, and the “good software made to do bad things” by malicious authors, i.e., malware. Understanding malware is an essential step for disinfection, risk assessment, and mitigation. With the ever-increasing volumes of infections reported every day, automation of malware analysis and classification became crucial. Malware classification and family identification are not new problems. However, the rapid evolution of the malware attack and defence ecosystem have enabled much fruitful research of analysis systems by capitalizing on a more exceptional understanding of the attack posture of today’s adversaries and malware authors.
<br><br>

<h3>Bringing AI to Edge</h3>
Edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning algorithms, are gradually intersecting to build novel systems, namely, edge intelligence. However, the development of edge intelligence systems encounters several challenges, and one of these challenges is the computational gap between computation-intensive deep learning algorithms and less-capable edge systems. We focus on developing and deploying methods that push DNNs to edge, including different metrics-oriented DNN models, applications-agnostic lightweight models, learning on the edge, and the data challenge at edge.
