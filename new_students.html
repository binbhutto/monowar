      <h3 class="content_separation">For non-UMU Students</h3>
      <div class="profile_sections">
        <p> There are available opportunities time to time to work in different projects as interns or visitors or
          collaborators with motivation either to join us for longer time later or long-term collaboration. For this,
          you
          need to drop an email at <a href="mailto: monowar@cs.umu.se" target="_top">monowar@cs.umu.se</a> by marking as
          "Potential student as (interns or visitors or collaborators) from (Name of your University or Institution,
          Country)" with your detailed CV and a short research proposal. </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="content_separation">For UMU CS and AI students</h3>
      <div class="profile_sections">
        <p>I am generally interested in machine learning and security and privacy. For
          information on the projects I am currently involved with, read my <a href="research.html">research page</a>.
          My
          work currently involves
          machine learning, anomaly detection, trustworthy learning, security and privacy, distributed computing.

          If you are a UMU CS or AI student, graduate or undergraduate,
          interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV,
          including a brief description of your background and any research
          experience. I will do my best to arrange a meeting with you shortly
          after I review your information. You can also stop by my office
          hours. I also suggest you read the following notes on what I expect
          from my students.</p>
      </div>


      <h3 class="content_separation">Advice for and Expectations from New Students</h3>
      <div class="profile_sections">
        <p>The following list summarizes my basic advice and expectations from the
          students I work with. Several of them are directly from David
          Patterson's talk on <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/nontech.html">"How
            to Have a Bad Career in Industry or Academia"</a>. </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Success is determined by you:</b> Your advisor can only
            set up an opportunity for research and provide feedback along the
            way. What you do with it is primarily up to you. Don't expect your
            advisor to tell you what to do from the very beginning till your
            very end of your studies. After a certain point, the ideas, the
            implementations, the papers, and the success will be mostly because
            of your talent and hard work. </li>
          <br>

          <li><b>Learn on your own:</b> Machine learning and security and privacy are a huge, fast moving field. Don't
            expect your advisor to know everything. Read
            and learn on your own. Attend seminars and conferences, talk with
            your colleagues (students or researchers or professors), read papers, follow
            references. Once you know a few new things about a topic, teach
            your advisor and projectmates about it... </li>
          <br>

          <li><b>Show initiative:</b> There are many quite students who can
            execute a task once they are told exactly what to do. The students that really
            excel are those who are active participants in a research
            group. Those who ask questions, offer replies, suggest new problems
            to work on, come up with innovative solutions to problems, spend
            extra time trying to analyze and verify the results of an experiment. So,
            don't sit back and wait to be told what to do. Be active. Every now
            and then you may ask a "stupid" question or suggest a "bad"
            idea. This is a natural part of the learning process... And don't get intimidated by the intelligence of the
            faculty or other students.</li>
          <br>

          <li><b>Work in group project</b>: Machine learning and security and privacy research is almost always a group
            activity. There are few great research ideas
            that can be handled by a single student these days. Many students
            have a hard time working in groups. The don't like sharing
            their new ideas or mistakes with others and have a general
            insecurity about who gets credit for what. Make your research group
            an asset instead of a problem. If you are a good team player you
            can benefit greatly from a group project. First, you will learn
            much more than your immediate research (expert in one topic and
            knowledgeable in many other). Second, you will probably end up with
            many more papers than if you worked on your own. You will have
            access to all the tools and technology developed in the group (less
            time spent implementing basic tools). In addition, the influence of
            the other team members will become a source of inspiration for
            you. Finally, you will make some good friends that will be very
            useful in the future, no matter what you do next...</li>
          <br>

          <li><b>Be broad</b>: Several student rush to overspecialize on a
            niche research domain. While this may seem the fastest way to get
            to results, you should try to resist the temptation. The importance
            of your research topic and the impact of your thesis will be much
            higher if you have a broad understanding of Machine learning and security and privacy
            technology. Don't just take machine learning classes. Take classes in
            operating systems, networking, distributed systems, security and privacy, and other systems area. Don't just
            attend seminars or talk just to
            students and faculty specializing in one field. </li>
          <br>


          <li><b>Be organized</b>: Organize your work to achieve short-term
            (daily, weekly) and long-term (monthly yearly) goals. Your time is
            a very valuable commodity. Use it in a smart way. In addition, keep
            good notes of the ideas, issues, and bugs you run into. This is the
            best way to avoid duplicating work and to have a head start on all
            papers, reports, etc. </li>

          <br>
          <li><b>Be honest about your work</b>: The worst thing you can do is to ruin
            your reputation as a student or as a researcher. Be honest when
            you promise to deliver something (result, paper, etc). Be honest
            when you present your research accomplishments. It is easy to be
            dishonest with both and get away with it in the short
            term. However, your advisor and colleagues will eventually catch
            up with you and, once your reputation is damaged, it is very
            difficult to recover.</li>
