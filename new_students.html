<h4>For non-UMU Students</h4>

 <p> There are available opportunities time to time to work in different projects as interns or visitors or collaborators with motivation either to join us for longer time later or long-term collaboration. For this, you need to drop an email at <a href="mailto: monowar@cs.umu.se" target="_top">monowar@cs.umu.se</a> by marking as "Potential student as (interns or visitors or collaborators) from (Name of your University or Institution, Country)" with your detailed CV and a short research proposal. </p>


<h4>For UMU CS and AI students</h4>


<p>I am generally interested in machine learning and security and privacy. For
  information on the projects I am currently involved with, read my <a
   href="research.html" >research page</a>. My work currently involves
  machine learning, anomaly detection, trustworthy learning, security and privacy, distributed computing.

If you are a UMU CS or AI student, graduate or undergraduate,
interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV,
including a brief description of your background and any research
experience. I will do my best to arrange a meeting with you shortly
after I review your information. You can also stop by my office
hours. I also suggest you read the following notes on what I expect
from my students.</p>


<h4>Advice for and Expectations from New Students</h4>


<p>The following list summarizes my basic advice and expectations from the
  students I work with. Several of them are directly from David
  Patterson's talk on <a
   href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/nontech.html">"How
  to Have a Bad Career in Industry or Academia"</a>. </p>

 <ul>
   <li><b>Success is determined by you:</b> Your advisor can only
   set up an opportunity for research and provide feedback along the
   way. What you do with it is primarily up to you. Don't expect your
   advisor to tell you what to do from the very beginning till your
   very end of your studies. After a certain point, the ideas, the
   implementations, the papers, and the success will be mostly because
   of your talent and hard work. </li>
	 <br>

   <li><b>Learn on your own:</b> Machine learning and security and privacy are a huge, fast moving field. Don't expect your advisor to know everything. Read
   and learn on your own. Attend seminars and conferences, talk with
   your colleagues (students or researchers or professors), read papers, follow
   references. Once you know a few new things about a topic, teach
   your advisor and projectmates about it... </li>
	 <br>

   <li><b>Show initiative:</b> There are many quite students who can
   execute a task once they are told exactly what to do. The students that really
   excel are those who are active participants in a research
   group. Those who ask questions, offer replies, suggest new problems
   to work on, come up with innovative solutions to problems, spend
   extra time trying to analyze and verify the results of an experiment. So,
   don't sit back and wait to be told what to do. Be active. Every now
   and then you may ask a "stupid" question or suggest a "bad"
   idea. This is a natural part of the learning process... And don't get intimidated by the intelligence of the faculty or other students.</li>
	 <br>

   <li><b>Work in group project</b>: Machine learning and security and privacy research is almost always a group activity. There are few great research ideas
   that can be handled by a single student these days.  Many students
   have a hard time working in groups. The don't like sharing
   their new ideas or mistakes with others and have a general
   insecurity about who gets credit for what. Make your research group
   an asset instead of a problem. If you are a good team player you
   can benefit greatly from a group project. First, you will learn
   much more than your immediate research (expert in one topic and
   knowledgeable in many other). Second, you will probably end up with
   many more papers than if you worked on your own. You will have
   access to all the tools and technology developed in the group (less
   time spent implementing basic tools). In addition, the influence of
   the other team members will become a source of inspiration for
   you. Finally, you will make some good friends that will be very
   useful in the future, no matter what you do next...</li>
	 <br>

   <li><b>Be broad</b>: Several student rush to overspecialize on a
   niche research domain. While this may seem the fastest way to get
   to results, you should try to resist the temptation. The importance
   of your research topic and the impact of your thesis will be much
   higher if you have a broad understanding of Machine learning and security and privacy
   technology. Don't just take machine learning classes. Take classes in
   operating systems, networking, distributed systems, security and privacy, and other systems area. Don't just attend seminars or talk just to
   students and faculty specializing in one field. </li>
	 <br>


   <li><b>Be organized</b>: Organize your work to achieve short-term
   (daily, weekly) and long-term (monthly yearly) goals. Your time is
   a very valuable commodity. Use it in a smart way. In addition, keep
   good notes of the ideas, issues, and bugs you run into. This is the
   best way to avoid duplicating work and to have a head start on all
   papers, reports, etc.  </li>

<br>
   <li><b>Be honest about your work</b>: The worst thing you can do is to ruin
      your reputation as a student or as a researcher. Be honest when
      you promise to deliver something (result, paper, etc). Be honest
      when you present your research accomplishments. It is easy to be
      dishonest with both and get away with it in the short
      term. However, your advisor and colleagues will eventually catch
      up with you and, once your reputation is damaged, it is very
      difficult to recover.</li>
