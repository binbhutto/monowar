				We are looking for a <a href="https://umu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:341327/"
					target="_blank">postdoctoral
					researcher</a> to work on robust machine learning and data-centric optimization. Very competitive
				salary. A tentative start date is September 1, 2020. The opening is for 2 years, and possibly renewable
				for
				more years (subject to the availability of funding). Candidates with a strong background in machine
				learning, distributed systems, security and privacy, anomaly detection, machine learning perspective
				optimization are encouraged to apply. In particular, an ideal candidate would have had previous
				experience
				exploring the "design and implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms" either by
				improvement
				or new algorithms. Also, it could be domain-dependent or independent. This position will be at Umeå
				University, Sweden. Applicants are expected at minimum to have excellent verbal and written English
				skills,
				sound logic, and demonstrated research record/potential in the above area. If interested in this
				position,
				please email me at <a href="mailto: monowar@cs.umu.se" target="_top">monowar@cs.umu.se</a> to discuss
				further. In your first email, please provide your C.V. in PDF.<br><br>

			<h3 class="content_separation">Ph.D. Students</h3>
			<div class="profile_sections">
				In Autonomous Distributed Systems Lab (ADS Lab), we are looking for creative, self-motivated and
				hardworking
				graduate students who want to pursue a Ph.D. degree by working with us on machine learning, systems
				security, privacy-aware learning, trustworthy learning, robust learning, distributed system, anomaly
				detection, AIOps, and machine learning perspective optimizations. Solid background of computer science,
				with
				strength in system building, data analysis, and usable theory are required. If interested in joining our
				group, please do the following.
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Read two (2) of our recent publications (from the past 1 years) to make sure that you are
						interested
						in what we do.</li>
					<li>Send me (at <a href="mailto: monowar@cs.umu.se" target="_top">monowar@cs.umu.se</a>) a brief
						summary
						of your background and a C.V. (PDF or txt files only! Should include your educational
						background,
						major coursework, main skills, and any publication), a summary of the 2 papers you read, and
						what
						you did not like about them. In the title of your first email, put “Potential Ph.D. student at
						ADS
						Lab” to let me know that you have read this note.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				All students admitted and accepted to work in my group will be funded in a form or another for their
				course
				of study.
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Are those Ph.D. positions guaranteed funding?</b><br>
						Yes. Funding is available to all qualified Ph.D. students.</li>
					<li><b>I don't have GRE and TOEFL scores. Can I still apply?</b><br>
						Yes, GRE and TOEFL (for international students) aren't mandatory, however, we appreaciate to
						have
						TOEFL score before admission.</li>
					<li><b>I am from country X, can I still apply?</b><br>
						Anyone from country X can apply, the Department and the University have no problem.</li>
					<li><b>How long does it take to finish a Ph.D.?</b><br>
						Typically 4 years but if you do teaching 20% every year then the funding will be extended upto 5
						years.</li>
					<li><b>Can you tell me my chances of getting admitted by looking at my C.V.?</b><br>
						No. Admission is not decided by me.</li>
					<li><b>How long should students spend on their research (in your group)?</b><br>
						Long enough to do their work and graduate.</li>
					<li><b>Would it be possible to work with you on project X?</b><br>
						Only if I am currently working on X.</li>
					<li><b>Can we talk? I am a student at UmU</b><br>
						Yes. Follow the instructions above.</li>
					<li><b>Can we talk? I am a student from country X.</b><br>
						Yes. Follow the instructions above.</li>

			<h3 class="content_separation">M.Sc. Students</h3>
			<div class="profile_sections">
				I have research projects for M.Sc. thesis students. If you are a self-motivated and hardworking student
				at
				UmU and would like to work on cool research projects in the above areas, send me an email to find a time
				to
				talk. NOTE: Students are expected to spend no less than 20 hours per week on their research as part of
				this
				position.
			</div>

			<h3 class="content_separation">Undergraduate Students</h3>
			<div class="profile_sections">

				Computer Science undergraduate students (senior or junior only) interested in working in our group
				should
				first consider taking fundamental computer science courses (e.g., computer networks, operating systems).
				Students with a solid computer science background and skills (i.e., programming -- preferably in Python,
				R,
				Java, algorithms, analysis, and curiosity) should contact me to set up a time to discuss potential
				projects.
			</div>


			<h3 class="content_separation">Interns</h3>
			<div class="profile_sections">
				I can host interns with exceptions and who can complement our research areas of interest.

			</div>
			<h3 class="content_separation">Visitors</h3>
			<div class="profile_sections">
				I occasionally have space and time to host fully-funded research visitors. Area-wise, I am
				interested in
				hosting visitors who can complement our areas of interest, including machine learning, data-driven
				security,
				online privacy, distributed learning, robuts learning, anomaly detection, and machine learning
				perspective
				optimization. A major theme that we seek collaboration on is big data security, machine learning,
				AI,
				trustworthy learning, privacy-aware learning, etc., and addressing representation, processing and
				analysis,
				decision-making, optimization mainly for security and privacy applications. If you are interested,
				email me
				to discuss such opportunities.
